### Event Filters

**Event Filter Toggles** can be selected or deselected to further refine the search criteria. For example, to filter out Driver Events, click the Driver Event filter slider to toggle it off. The slider will slide to the left and a grey background with an "X" will appear to signify that filter toggle is in the off position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page is a step-by-step overview of the **Data Usage** page on RoscoLive. The **Data Usage** page is available to all permission levels for end-users.  
  
The **Data Usage** page is where customers with RoscoLive mobile network services can view the data usage for each vehicle or Group. These reports can also be exported in *comma-separated version* (**CSV**) format.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Data Usage page

Locate and select the **Fleet Administration** option in the side-bar menu.

## Step 2: Data Usage page

This is the **Data Usage** page. From here, the data usage from the fleet is put into a table by Groups and individual vehicles. Next to each Group name is a (+) that when selected expands that Group category to reveal all the vehicles within that Group. This table as well as all other tables on this page can be exported in a CSV file. If you are unsure how to export a CSV file, refer to this [page.](/rosco/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/reports/csv_reports#step_1select_a_table_to_export)

The columns of this page are the following:

1.  **Group Name** - The name of the Groups in the fleet
2.  **Start Date** - The start date of the data displayed on the table. This can be changed at the top of the page.
3.  \*\*End Date \*\* - The end date of the data displayed on the table. This can be changed at the top of the page.
4.  **Traffic up (MB)** - This is the data traffic measured in megabytes from the camera to the server.
5.  **Traffic down (MB)** - This is the data traffic measured in megabytes from the server to the camera.

### Searching Data

To change the date range for the data displayed, select a **Start Date** and **End Date** at the top of the page. Click **Reload** to reload the table.

The search bar at the top of this page can be used to search for vehicles with similar names or individual vehicles. As the user is entering the vehicle name in the search bar, the Groups list actively narrows down the vehicle names according to how specific the name entered is. For an example of this, refer to this [page](/rosco/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/fleet_administration/fleet_firmware_update#searching_for_vehicles).

### Fleet Groups Data page

This is the fleet group data pages. These contain all of the vehicles within the specified fleet and their data usage in table form. If the search function is used, only the vehicles that match the search criteria will show up.

1.  **Name/ID** - The vehicle's name or ID number.
2.  **Traffic up (MB)** - This is the data traffic measured in megabytes from the camera to the server.
3.  **Traffic down (MB)** - This is the data traffic measured in megabytes from the server to the camera.

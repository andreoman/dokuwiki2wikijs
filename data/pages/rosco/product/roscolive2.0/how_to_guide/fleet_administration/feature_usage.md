ref: RoscoLive v2.3.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page is a step-by-step overview of the **Feature Usage** page on RoscoLive. The **Feature Usage** page is available to all permission levels for end-users.  
  
The **Feature Usage** page is where the features offered by RoscoLive such as live video, event clips, and custom clips are recorded for each vehicle in the fleet and put into a searchable table. The user can specify date ranges and access the amount of use for each of the features of each vehicle in the fleet within that range.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Feature Usage page

Locate and select the **Fleet Administration** option in the side-bar menu.

## Step 2: Feature Usage page

This is the **Feature Usage** page. From here, the user may view the feature use of all the vehicles within the fleet. The list is by default in ascending order by vehicle name and the end date by default is the current date.

1.  **Name** - The name of the vehicle.
2.  **Group** - The group that the vehicle is assigned to.
3.  **Start Date** - The beginning of the date range specified for this data set.
4.  **End Date** - The end of the date range specified for this data set.
5.  **Live Video (min)** - The length of live video in minutes that the vehicle has streamed within the date range specified. For example, 1.80 minutes is 1 minute and (0.80 • 60 seconds) 48 seconds.

7.  **Custom Clips** - The amount of custom clips recorded for that vehicle within the date range specified.

### Search Bar & Date Range

The search bar at the top of this page can be used to search for vehicles with similar names or individual vehicles. As the user is entering the vehicle name in the search bar, the list actively narrows down the vehicle names according to how specific the name entered is. For an example of this, refer to this [page](/rosco/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/fleet_administration/fleet_firmware_update#searching_for_vehicles).

# Dual-Vision® XC4

### Introduction

Rosco’s DVXC4 is a windshield based, continuous recording camera solution that provides the end user with real-time access to on-road events, GPS vehicle tracking, and reporting. The two-way windshield camera has auxiliary inputs to display up to 8 additional cameras in a quad view channel layout. Events that occur on the road trigger the camera system to tag videos which are then stored and prioritized within the SD card of the camera. Videos can also be sent to the cloud to be available for playback and download with the purchase of the [RoscoLive system](/user/product/roscolive2.0/home). Livestream video is available over the 4G network to view your vehicles wherever you are. Corresponding metadata enables fleet managers to have side-by-side information with the video files. The fully outfitted camera-based solution ensures that fleet managers have total control and visibility over their vehicles.

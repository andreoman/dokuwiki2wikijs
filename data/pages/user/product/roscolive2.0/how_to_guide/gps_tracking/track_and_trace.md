-   **Start Tracking** - Enables or disables live tracking for that vehicle on the Google Maps overlay.
-   **Trip Replay** - Opens the trip replay player at the bottom of the screen for selected vehicle's playback.
-   **Zoom To Vehicle** - Zooms into the location that specific vehicle is in or its last known location if network connectivity is lost.  
      

## Step 3: Trip Replay

This is the **Trip Replay Player**. When trip replay is selected for the vehicle, this player opens up at the bottom of the screen.

The trip replay player allows fleet managers to playback one or more selected vehicle's routes and any events or alerts recorded during the route. The player allows for date and time to be specified as well. The Google Maps overlay also has the vehicle icon on it with a travel trail of the vehicle's route taken to help visualize the information better. To stop trip replay, simply select the trip replay icon again for each vehicle.

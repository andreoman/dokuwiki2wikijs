# How to Manage Users

This page is a step-by-step overview of the **Manage Users** page on RoscoLive. The **Manage Users** page is available to those end-users with permissions **Group Maintainer** and above.  
  

The **Manage Users** page is where user accounts within a fleet can be managed and created.  
***NOTE**: Some options may differ according to what permissions the end-user has.*

## Step 1: Navigate to the Manage Users page

## Step 2: Manage Users page

This is the **Manage Users** page. From here, user accounts can be added, edited, deleted, or viewed according to the available permissions the logged in user has. The search bar at the top of the page is used to quickly search for specific user accounts.

3.  **Last Name** - The new user's last name.
4.  **Role** - Select the new user's role in the drop-down list. This determines the permissions the new user will have and what information they will be allowed to see and edit. More information about user roles can be found [here](/user/product/roscolive2.0/user_roles).
5.  **Group** - This option is for **User** and **Group Manager** roles. This allocates what groups the new user will have access to. Multiple groups can be selected, but at least one needs to be selected in order to create the new user.

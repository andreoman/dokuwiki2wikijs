## Step 2: Feature Usage

This is the **Feature Usage** page. The table displays all of the vehicles in the fleet and information regarding event activity, when the vehicle was last connected, and an audit report for each vehicle. The search bar at the top of this page can be used to search for vehicles with similar names or individual vehicles. As the user is entering the vehicle name in the search bar, the list actively narrows down the vehicle names according to how specific the name entered is. For an example of this, refer to this [page](/user/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/fleet_administration/fleet_firmware_update#searching_for_vehicles).

The date range of the information displayed can be changed by entering the start and end dates for the desired date range and selecting **Reload**.

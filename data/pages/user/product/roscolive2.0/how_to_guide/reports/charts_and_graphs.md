- **Report Name** - Enter the name for the report into this field.

1.  **Graph Type** - Click this drop-down menu to select either a bar graph or pie chart for the report. There are several different data sets to choose from for each graph type.
2.  **Stacked/Not Stacked Toggle Switch** - This switch toggles the way the bar graph displays the data set. *Stacked* view stacks the data onto a single column for each vehicle in the graph. *Not Stacked* view stacks the data in individual columns for each vehicle in the graph.
3.   **Start Date / End Date** - Specifies the time frame for the data represented in the graph.
4.  **Events / Alert Filters** - Filters the types of alerts and events to be represented in the data set. Multiple events and alerts can be selected or deselected, but at least one is needed to create a report.

After the desired settings are selected, click **Save Change** to create the report.

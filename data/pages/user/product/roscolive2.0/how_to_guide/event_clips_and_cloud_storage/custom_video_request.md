# How to use Custom Video Request

A **Custom Video Request** can be used when the need for a non-event related video clip is required. This function sends the request to the vehicle or vehicles specified. When network connectivity is available, the vehicle will then upload the requested video to the **Event Clips & Cloud Storage** page for viewing or download.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Custom Video Request window

The **Custom Video Request** button is located near the vehicle search bar on the **Event Clips & Cloud Storage** page.

## Step 2: Request a Custom Video

The **Custom Video Request** window should look something similar to this:

Simply select the vehicle in the drop-down search bar, select a date and time, select desired video length(30 seconds to 15 minutes), add any relevant notes and click **Request**. The video request will appear in the **Event Clips & Cloud Storage** page.  
A notification will appear at the top right of the screen to confirm video request was successful.

<u>***IMPORTANT NOTE**: RoscoLive uses the timezone of its end user's computer. If a vehicle is in a timezone different from the end user, RoscoLive will adjust the time difference for the custom video request. The user will do the following: Make custom video request in reference to their timezone e.g. Make request 10 AM EST for a video 9 AM CST.*</u>  
  

### Multiple Custom Video Requests

The **Custom Video Request** window allows for multiple requests to be entered simultaneously. To do this, click on the *Add Videos* button for every request needed. <img src="/rosco/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/event_clips_and_cloud_storage/rlcustom_vid_req_addvideobutton.jpg" class="align-center" width="200" />  
  
The *Add Videos* button was pressed 3 times in this example for a total of 4 custom video requests: <img src="/rosco/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/event_clips_and_cloud_storage/rlcustom_vid_req_multiplevidreq.jpg" class="align-center" width="400" />  
  
Press the grey minus button next to each video request to remove it from the request queue.  
  

## Step 3: Custom Video Request in queue

After the request has been sent for the custom video, an entry for it will appear on the **Event Clips & Cloud Storage** page. The entries will look similar to the page below: <img src="/user/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/event_clips_and_cloud_storage/rlcustom_vid_req_pendingvidreq.jpg" class="align-center" width="800" /> Notice that the **Type** is *Custom* for custom video requests.  
  
When the selected vehicles are within network range or the next time they are within network range, the uploading process will begin for the requested videos.  
<u>**Before**</u> the video has begun uploading to the cloud, a request may be canceled by selecting the red circle icon with the "X" for each video request. A prompt will appear asking for confirmation. <img src="/user/product/roscolive2.0/how_to_guide/event_clips_and_cloud_storage/rlcustom_vid_req_deleteconfirm.jpg" class="align-center" width="400" />  
  
When the deletion is confirmed, the custom event video request will be deleted and a confirmation will appear in the top right of the page.

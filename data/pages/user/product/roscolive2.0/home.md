# Roscolive 2.0

### Introduction

RoscoLive 2.0 is the new, revamped user interface that complements the [Dual-Vision® XC4](/user/product/dual-vision_recording/dual-vision_xc4/home) camera system. RoscoLive 2.0 users have seamless access to GPS tracking and route history playback, event-video view and management, reporting, and optional live stream video feed. In the new UI, accessing and managing your vehicles is simple as ever. You’ll find all of your vehicles on the real-time homepage and be able to see all event videos with just the click of a button. Sort or filter through all of your videos by vehicle, event type, and time. Request minutes of custom requested video for when you need to capture more than the event itself. Fleet managers can adjust settings and system preferences with an easy to use the sidebar. With the DVXC4 system on RoscoLive 2.0, all can be performed remotely.

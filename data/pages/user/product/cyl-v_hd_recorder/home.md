# Cyl-V HD Recorder

### Introduction

Cyl-V™ is a single outward facing camera offering incredible HD video and audio (configurable setting - on/off) recording, which is saved to a micro SD card.  
Secured with a unique lock so that it can’t be removed, tampered with, or have the micro SD card taken, and hardwired for automatic startup and shutdown with vehicle ignition (or even record after ignition shut-off by option).  
Recording time varies with video quality selected, but a minimum of 3.5 continuous hours recording at HD 720 and 30 frames per second are possible. The video works in a loop format and runs infinitely, replacing oldest video footage with newest. A built-in accelerometer precisely calculates G-force events and highlights this video footage so that risky, distracted, or concerning behavior can be spotted immediately upon video review. Drivers are also notified of G-force or speeding event occurrences with a friendly chime and reminder that they are to avoid such actions.  
  
Post route, the GPS location data allows the user to pinpoint and play video at specific locations on Google Maps.
